# AI-Driven Crop Yield Prediction for Climate Action

## Introduction
Welcome to **Team [Insert Team Name]**'s project for the AI Tools Assignment! This project addresses **UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action** by developing a machine learning model to predict crop yields based on climate variables. Using a **PyTorch neural network** and **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing, our solution helps farmers adapt to climate change, optimize resources, and combat food insecurity (indirectly supporting **SDG 2: Zero Hunger**). This repository contains well-commented code, a Jupyter notebook, and documentation to demonstrate our proficiency in AI frameworks, as evaluated by the assignment’s theoretical, practical, and ethical components.

**Why This Matters**: Climate change reduces crop yields by up to 20% for key crops by 2050, exacerbating poverty and inequality. Our AI-driven approach provides actionable predictions to support sustainable agriculture, aligning with the UN’s vision of AI as a bridge to sustainability.

## Project Overview
- **Problem**: Climate variability (e.g., rising temperatures, erratic rainfall) disrupts agriculture, leaving farmers unprepared due to inaccurate traditional forecasting.
- **Solution**: A supervised learning model using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network to predict crop yields from inputs like temperature (°C), rainfall (mm/year), and pesticide usage (tons).
- **Tools**:
  - **PyTorch**: For building and training the neural network.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing (normalization) and evaluation (MSE).
  - **Matplotlib**: For visualizing model performance.
  - **Google Colab**: For cloud-based execution with GPU support.
- **Data**: Synthetic dataset mimicking real-world climate-yield relationships (inspired by Kaggle’s Crop Yield Prediction Dataset). Future iterations could use FAO or World Bank data.
- **Impact**: Enables data-driven farming, reduces emissions through optimized resource use, and supports smallholder farmers in climate-vulnerable regions.

## UN SDG Alignment
This project directly supports **SDG 13: Climate Action** by providing tools to mitigate climate impacts on agriculture. It also contributes to:
- **SDG 2: Zero Hunger** by improving yield reliability.
- **SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities** by prioritizing solutions accessible to smallholder farmers in developing countries.
